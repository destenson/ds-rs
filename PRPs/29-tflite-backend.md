# PRP-29: TensorFlow Lite Backend Implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement TensorFlow Lite as a detection backend optimized for mobile and edge devices, providing superior performance on ARM processors and supporting quantized models for resource-constrained environments.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Current backends (ONNX, OpenCV) are optimized for desktop/server CPUs but not for mobile/edge devices. Quantized model support is limited, and ARM-specific optimizations are not fully utilized.

### Desired State
TFLite backend providing optimized inference on mobile/edge devices, supporting INT8/INT16 quantized models, with delegate support for hardware acceleration (NNAPI, CoreML, etc.).

### Business Value
- Enables deployment on Raspberry Pi, Android, iOS devices
- Reduces model size by 4x with quantization
- Lower power consumption for battery-powered devices
- Faster inference on ARM processors

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **TFLite Integration**: Load and run TensorFlow Lite models
2. **Quantization Support**: Handle INT8/INT16 quantized models
3. **Delegate Support**: Use hardware acceleration when available
4. **Model Metadata**: Parse TFLite metadata for labels and preprocessing
5. **Edge TPU Support**: Optional Coral Edge TPU acceleration

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: 2-4x faster than ONNX on ARM devices
2. **Memory**: Support models under 10MB
3. **Power Efficiency**: Optimize for battery-powered devices
4. **Cross-Platform**: Work on Linux ARM, Android, iOS

### Context and Research

TFLite achieves 2-3x speedup on mobile devices compared to full TensorFlow, with quantized models providing additional 4x size reduction and 2x speed improvement. Critical for edge deployment scenarios.

### List of tasks to be completed to fulfill the PRP in the order they should be completed

```yaml
Task 1:
CREATE crates/cpuinfer/src/tflite_detector.rs:
  - DEFINE TFLiteDetector struct
  - IMPLEMENT model loading with tflite-rs or custom FFI
  - HANDLE quantized and float models differently
  - PARSE model metadata for preprocessing params

Task 2:
IMPLEMENT preprocessing for TFLite:
  - HANDLE quantization scale/zero-point
  - IMPLEMENT resize with correct interpolation
  - NORMALIZE based on model requirements
  - CONVERT to correct tensor format

Task 3:
IMPLEMENT trait Detector for TFLiteDetector:
  - IMPLEMENT detect() with interpreter.invoke()
  - DEQUANTIZE outputs if needed
  - PARSE detection outputs (SSD, YOLO formats)
  - HANDLE variable output tensor counts

Task 4:
CREATE crates/cpuinfer/src/tflite_delegates.rs:
  - DETECT available delegates (NNAPI, GPU, CoreML)
  - IMPLEMENT delegate creation and configuration
  - FALLBACK to CPU if delegate fails
  - ADD Edge TPU support detection

Task 5:
MODIFY crates/cpuinfer/src/detector_factory.rs:
  - ADD TFLite backend case
  - CHECK for tflite feature flag
  - CONFIGURE delegates based on platform
  - HANDLE model compatibility checks

Task 6:
CREATE tests/tflite_detector_tests.rs:
  - TEST float and quantized models
  - VERIFY accuracy with tolerance for quantization
  - BENCHMARK on ARM vs x86
  - TEST delegate fallback behavior

Task 7:
ADD build configuration:
  - SETUP TFLite library linking
  - HANDLE cross-compilation for ARM
  - OPTIONAL Edge TPU library detection
  - DOCUMENT build requirements per platform
```

### Out of Scope
- Model conversion to TFLite format
- Training or fine-tuning
- Custom operator implementation
- Android/iOS app integration

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Successfully loads TFLite models (float32 and int8)
- [ ] 2x performance improvement on ARM devices
- [ ] Quantized models maintain 95% accuracy
- [ ] Delegates work when available
- [ ] Cross-compiles for ARM targets

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- TensorFlow Lite C library (2.13+)
- tflite-rs crate or custom FFI bindings
- Detector trait from PRP-27
- Cross-compilation toolchain for ARM

### Knowledge Dependencies
- TFLite model format understanding
- Quantization concepts
- Delegate API usage
- ARM optimization techniques

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| TFLite API changes | Low | Medium | Pin to stable version, abstract API calls |
| Quantization accuracy loss | Medium | Medium | Provide accuracy vs speed tradeoff options |
| Delegate compatibility | High | Low | Robust fallback to CPU implementation |
| Cross-compilation issues | Medium | Medium | Provide pre-built binaries, Docker images |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: FFI Bindings vs Rust Crate
**Options Considered:**
1. Use tflite-rs crate
2. Custom FFI bindings
3. Use tensorflow-rust with TFLite module

**Decision:** Start with tflite-rs, fallback to custom FFI if needed

**Rationale:** Existing crate reduces development time, but custom FFI provides more control if limitations found.

### Decision: Quantization Handling
**Options Considered:**
1. Only support float models
2. Full quantization support
3. Automatic dequantization

**Decision:** Full quantization support with explicit handling

**Rationale:** Quantization is key value proposition for edge devices, must be first-class feature.

## Validation Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Model loading and preprocessing
- **Integration Testing**: Full detection pipeline
- **Performance Testing**: ARM vs x86 benchmarks
- **Accuracy Testing**: Quantized vs float model comparison
- **Hardware Testing**: Test on Raspberry Pi, Coral Dev Board

## Future Considerations

- Custom operator support for specialized models
- Model pipelining for video streams
- Dynamic quantization based on available resources
- TFLite Micro support for microcontrollers
