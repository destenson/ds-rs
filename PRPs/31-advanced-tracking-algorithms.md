# PRP-31: Advanced Tracking Algorithms Implementation

## Executive Summary

Implement state-of-the-art multi-object tracking algorithms (SORT, Deep SORT, ByteTrack) to provide robust object tracking across frames, handling occlusions, identity switches, and fast-moving objects in video streams.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
Basic centroid tracker exists but lacks robustness for real-world scenarios. No handling of occlusions, poor performance with fast-moving objects, and frequent identity switches in crowded scenes.

### Desired State
Multiple advanced tracking algorithms available with Kalman filtering for motion prediction, deep feature extraction for re-identification, and sophisticated association strategies that maintain consistent object identities.

### Business Value
- Enables accurate people counting and flow analysis
- Supports behavior analysis and anomaly detection
- Reduces false positives in security applications
- Enables trajectory analysis for traffic monitoring

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **SORT Implementation**: Simple Online Realtime Tracking with Kalman filter
2. **Deep SORT**: SORT with deep appearance features
3. **ByteTrack**: Associate every detection box, including low confidence
4. **Unified Interface**: Common trait for all tracking algorithms
5. **Track Management**: Birth, death, and occlusion handling

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Real-time tracking at 30+ FPS
2. **Accuracy**: MOTA score > 60 on MOT benchmarks
3. **Scalability**: Handle 100+ simultaneous tracks
4. **Memory**: Efficient track history management

### Context and Research

Research shows ByteTrack achieves 80.3 MOTA on MOT17 with simple association strategy. SORT provides good baseline with Kalman filtering. Deep SORT adds robustness through appearance features. Rust implementations exist that can be referenced.

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Kalman Filter Implementation
**Options Considered:**
1. Custom implementation
2. Use external crate (e.g., kalman-rust)
3. Port from OpenCV

**Decision:** Custom implementation with nalgebra

**Rationale:** Full control over numerical stability and optimization, avoiding external dependencies.

### Decision: Association Algorithm
**Options Considered:**
1. Greedy nearest neighbor
2. Hungarian algorithm
3. Custom optimization

**Decision:** Hungarian algorithm with cost matrix

**Rationale:** Optimal assignment guarantee, widely used in tracking literature.

### Decision: Feature Storage Strategy
**Options Considered:**
1. Store all historical features
2. Running average of features
3. Fixed-size feature gallery

**Decision:** Fixed-size gallery with LRU replacement

**Rationale:** Balances memory usage with re-identification capability.

## Validation Strategy
