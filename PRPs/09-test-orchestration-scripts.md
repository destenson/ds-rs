# PRP: Integration and End-to-End Test Orchestration Scripts

## Executive Summary

Create practical test orchestration scripts (PowerShell, Python, shell) to automate integration and end-to-end testing for the DeepStream Rust port project. These scripts will coordinate testing across multiple crates, manage test dependencies like RTSP servers, and provide comprehensive test execution workflows for local development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- 107 tests exist across ds-rs and source-videos crates requiring manual coordination
- Integration testing requires manual setup of source-videos RTSP server
- End-to-end workflows (ds-app with actual video sources) lack automated validation
- Different backend combinations need manual testing across platforms
- No standardized test orchestration for CI/CD pipeline integration
- Developers must manually manage test dependencies and cleanup

### Desired State
- Automated test orchestration scripts that handle setup, execution, and cleanup
- One-command integration testing across all crates and scenarios
- End-to-end validation of complete workflows with actual video sources
- Cross-platform test execution with proper backend selection
- CI/CD ready scripts with proper error handling and reporting
- Comprehensive test coverage including backend-specific and integration scenarios

### Business Value
Enables reliable automated testing for production deployments, reduces manual testing overhead, and provides consistent test execution across development and CI/CD environments.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Test Orchestration**: Coordinate test execution across ds-rs and source-videos crates
2. **Dependency Management**: Start/stop RTSP servers, manage test data, handle process lifecycle
3. **Backend Testing**: Test different backend combinations (Mock, Standard, DeepStream)
4. **End-to-End Validation**: Test complete workflows from source-videos to ds-app
5. **Cross-Platform Support**: PowerShell (Windows), Python (cross-platform), shell (Linux/macOS)
6. **CI/CD Integration**: Generate reports, handle exit codes, support automation
7. **Error Recovery**: Proper cleanup on failures, process management, resource handling

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Reliability**: Scripts handle failures gracefully with proper cleanup
2. **Performance**: Parallel test execution where possible, efficient resource usage
3. **Maintainability**: Clear script structure, configurable parameters, logging
4. **Portability**: Work across Windows, Linux, macOS development environments

### Context and Research

Current testing infrastructure includes:
- ds-rs crate: 94 tests (70 unit + 9 backend + 13 pipeline + 2 app)
- source-videos crate: 24 tests for RTSP server and video generation
- Examples: cross_platform.rs, runtime_demo.rs, detection_app.rs
- Applications: ds-app (main), source-videos CLI tool

Testing gaps identified:
- No coordination between crates during testing
- Manual RTSP server setup required for integration tests
- End-to-end scenarios not automated
- Backend-specific testing requires manual environment setup

## Risks and Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| Process management complexity | Medium | Medium | Use well-tested libraries, implement proper cleanup |
| Cross-platform compatibility | Medium | Medium | Test on all target platforms, provide platform-specific fallbacks |
| Test flakiness with timing | Medium | High | Implement proper wait conditions, add retries for transient failures |
| Resource cleanup failures | Low | High | Use try/finally patterns, implement cleanup verification |

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Multi-Language Approach
**Options Considered:**
1. PowerShell only (Windows-focused)
2. Python only (cross-platform)
3. Multi-language approach (PowerShell + Python + shell)

**Decision:** Option 3 - Multi-language approach

**Rationale:** Provides native experience on each platform while enabling cross-platform CI/CD

### Decision: Configuration Format
**Options Considered:**
1. Command-line arguments only
2. JSON configuration files
3. TOML configuration files

**Decision:** Option 2 - JSON configuration with CLI overrides

**Rationale:** JSON is widely supported across all scripting languages, easy to parse and modify

## Validation Strategy

### Validation Commands
```bash
# PowerShell validation
scripts/test-orchestrator.ps1 -Scenario unit
scripts/test-orchestrator.ps1 -Scenario integration
scripts/test-orchestrator.ps1 -Scenario e2e
