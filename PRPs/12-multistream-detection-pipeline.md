# PRP: Multi-Stream Detection Pipeline Architecture

## Executive Summary

Scale the single-stream ball detection and visualization system to handle multiple concurrent RTSP streams simultaneously. This PRP implements a multi-stream architecture that can process several source-videos streams in parallel, each with independent ball detection and bounding box rendering, demonstrating the system's scalability for real-world deployment scenarios.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- PRP-10 and PRP-11 provide ball detection and rendering for single streams
- ds-rs source management system supports multiple sources but processes them through single pipeline
- source-videos can serve multiple test streams (test1, test2, test3) concurrently
- No architecture for concurrent detection processing across multiple streams
- Resource management not designed for multiple simultaneous inference operations

### Desired State
- Concurrent processing of multiple RTSP streams with ball detection
- Independent detection and rendering for each stream
- Resource-aware scheduling and load balancing across streams
- Scalable architecture supporting configurable number of concurrent streams
- Unified management interface for multi-stream operations

### Business Value
Demonstrates production-ready scalability for surveillance systems, multi-camera monitoring, and distributed video analytics scenarios. Validates the architecture's ability to handle real-world deployment requirements with multiple concurrent video sources.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Multi-Stream Management**: Process multiple RTSP streams concurrently
2. **Independent Detection**: Separate ball detection pipeline for each stream
3. **Resource Scheduling**: Efficient allocation of CPU/GPU resources across streams
4. **Stream Synchronization**: Coordinate multiple detection and rendering operations
5. **Dynamic Stream Addition**: Add/remove streams without affecting others
6. **Unified Monitoring**: Single interface to monitor all stream statuses
7. **Error Isolation**: Stream failures don't affect other concurrent streams

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Scalability**: Support 4-8 concurrent streams on standard hardware
2. **Performance**: Maintain >15 FPS per stream with detection and rendering
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Optimal CPU/GPU utilization without resource starvation
4. **Reliability**: Graceful handling of individual stream failures
5. **Memory Management**: Bounded memory usage regardless of stream count

### Context and Research

The source-videos test infrastructure already provides multiple test streams:
- rtsp://127.0.0.1:8554/test1, test2, test3 with different patterns
- test2 specifically contains the bouncing ball pattern
- Each stream can run independently and be accessed concurrently

The ds-rs architecture includes SourceManager with thread-safe registry using Arc<RwLock<HashMap>>, indicating existing multi-source capabilities. The challenge is scaling the detection and rendering pipeline to handle multiple concurrent streams efficiently.
