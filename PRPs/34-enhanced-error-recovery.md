# PRP: Enhanced Error Recovery and Fault Tolerance

## Executive Summary

Implement comprehensive error recovery mechanisms to handle transient failures, network interruptions, and stream instability in production environments. The current system fails permanently on any error, making it unsuitable for real-world deployments where network reliability and stream stability are critical concerns.

## Problem Statement

### Current State
- Sources fail permanently on first error with no retry attempts
- No isolation between streams - one failure can affect the entire pipeline
- Missing health monitoring for proactive issue detection
- No automatic reconnection for network streams (RTSP/HTTP)
- Errors are only logged, not recovered from
- No backpressure or circuit breaker mechanisms

### Desired State
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient failures
- Stream isolation ensuring independent failure handling
- Health monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Automatic reconnection for network sources
- Circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
- Graceful degradation under partial failures
- Comprehensive error metrics and observability

### Business Value
Production deployments require 24/7 operation with minimal human intervention. Network streams are inherently unreliable - temporary network issues, source restarts, and bandwidth fluctuations are common. Without robust error recovery, operators must manually restart applications, leading to downtime and missed events. This PRP enables true production readiness.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Retry Mechanism with Exponential Backoff**
   - Configurable retry attempts (default: 3)
   - Exponential backoff starting at 1 second
   - Maximum backoff cap (default: 60 seconds)
   - Jitter to prevent thundering herd

2. **Stream Isolation**
   - Each source wrapped in error boundary
   - Failures don't propagate to other sources
   - Independent retry logic per source
   - Quarantine mechanism for consistently failing sources

3. **Health Monitoring**
   - Periodic health checks for each source
   - Configurable health check intervals
   - Frame rate monitoring
   - Buffer underrun detection
   - Network latency tracking for RTSP sources

4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Open circuit after threshold failures
   - Half-open state for testing recovery
   - Closed circuit on successful recovery
   - Per-source circuit breaker state

5. **Automatic Reconnection**
   - RTSP sources auto-reconnect on disconnect
   - HTTP sources retry on network errors
   - File sources handle temporary unavailability
   - Preserve source configuration across reconnects

6. **Error Classification**
   - Transient vs permanent error detection
   - Network vs decode vs pipeline errors
   - Severity levels for different error types
   - Action mapping based on error classification

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: Recovery attempts should not block pipeline
2. **Observability**: Detailed metrics for all recovery attempts
3. **Configuration**: Runtime adjustable recovery parameters
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing code continues to work
5. **Testing**: Fault injection for recovery validation

### Context and Research

The implementation should follow established patterns from distributed systems and streaming architectures. Key references include Netflix's Hystrix for circuit breakers, AWS SDK retry strategies, and Kubernetes pod restart policies.

## Architecture Decisions

### Decision: Recovery Library Choice
**Options Considered:**
1. tokio-retry with async runtime
2. Custom implementation with glib timers
3. backoff crate with blocking retries

**Decision:** Option 2 - Custom implementation with glib timers

**Rationale:** Consistent with existing timer patterns, avoids tokio dependency, integrates naturally with GStreamer event loop

### Decision: Error Classification Strategy
**Options Considered:**
1. Static error type mapping
2. Heuristic-based classification
3. Configurable classification rules

**Decision:** Option 1 with Option 3 extension points

**Rationale:** Predictable behavior with flexibility for custom rules

### Decision: Health Check Implementation
**Options Considered:**
1. GStreamer queries
2. Pad probes monitoring
3. External process monitoring

**Decision:** Option 2 - Pad probes for non-intrusive monitoring

**Rationale:** Most accurate, least overhead, native GStreamer pattern

## Validation Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Test each recovery component in isolation
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end recovery scenarios
- **Fault Injection**: Simulate various failure modes
- **Performance Testing**: Measure recovery overhead
- **Stress Testing**: Multiple simultaneous failures
- **Long-running Tests**: 24+ hour stability validation

### Validation Commands
```bash
# Build and format check
cargo fmt --check && cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings

# Run all tests including recovery tests
cargo test --all-features -- --nocapture

# Run specific recovery test suite
cargo test recovery -- --nocapture

# Run fault injection example
cargo run --example fault_tolerant_pipeline

# Stress test with multiple failures
cargo test stress_recovery --release -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
```

## Future Considerations

- Integration with observability platforms (Prometheus/Grafana)
- Machine learning for predictive failure detection
- Distributed recovery coordination for multi-instance deployments
- Custom recovery strategies per source type
- Recovery state persistence for application restarts
- Advanced circuit breaker algorithms (adaptive thresholds)
