## Recent Changes
- 2025-08-27: Analyzed 30 PRPs, found 8 completed and 11 partial
- PRP-19 (Network Simulation): COMPLETE - Full implementation with profiles
- PRP-21 (CPU Detection): PARTIAL - cpudetector module exists
- PRP-39 (REPL): COMPLETE - Full REPL with command completion
- PRP-51 (CPUInfer Plugin): COMPLETE - Working GStreamer plugin
- source-videos crate: Major features including network sim, REPL, REST API

## Key Findings
- **Numbering Issues**: Multiple PRPs share the same numbers (02, 03, 19, 33, 54, 99)
- **Core Functionality**: Basic pipeline and source management is complete
- **Cross-Platform**: Strong backend abstraction implemented beyond original plans
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test files exist (7 test files found)
- **source-videos Crate**: Separate crate created for video source management
